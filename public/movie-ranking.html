<h1>Best movies according to Eduardo</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    This is the best sci-fi off all time. There is a lot of time-trips, and I love time-trips!
</p>

<h3>Matrix 1</h3>
<p>
    The movie that changed the film industry, technically speaking.<br />
    And of course, a very interesting script with the domain of IA's.
</p>

<h3>The Godfather Trilogy</h3>
<p>
    Lauched in 1977, this is the topnotch trylogy of all time! Crimes, italian Mob, intrigues, everuthing is there!
